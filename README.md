# bci-essentials-python
This reposity contains python modules and scripts for the processing of EEG-based BCI. 
These modules are specifically designed to be equivalent whether run offline or online.

### bci-essentials-unity
The front end for this package can be found in [bci-essentials-unity](https://www.github.com/kirtonBCIlab/bci-essentials-unity)

## Getting Started
It is recommended to use anaconda or miniconda, all conda commands must be run from the anaconda prompt unless anaconda has been added to PATH.
Alternatively, a regular python virtual environment should be sufficient.

1. clone from git
>git clone https://github.com/kirtonBCIlab/bci-essentials-python.git
2. Create a conda environment from the bci_essentials_env.yml an activate it
>conda env create -f env/bci_essentials_env.yml
>conda activate bci_essentials
2. OR use pip to install to a virtual environment
>pip install virtualenv
>virtualenv bci_essentials
>source bci_essentials/bin/activate
>pip install -r env/bci_essentials_requirements.txt
3. Update pyriemann to the latest version from github
>pip install git+https://github.com/pyRiemann/pyRiemann

## Offline processing
Offline processing can be done by running the corresponding offline test script (ie. mi_offline_test.py, p300_offline_test.py, etc.)
Change the filename in the script to point to the data you want to process.
Test something 
>python examples/mi_offline_test.py


## Online processing
Online processing requires an EEG stream and a marker stream. These can both be simulated using eeg_lsl_sim.py and marker_lsl_sim.py.
Real EEG streams come from a headset connected over LSL. Real marker streams come from the application in the Unity frontend.
Once these streams are running, simply begin the backend processing script ( ie. mi_unity_backend.py, p300_unity_bakend.py, etc.)
It is recommended to save the EEG, marker, and response (created by the backend processing script) streams using 
[Lab Recorder](https://github.com/labstreaminglayer/App-LabRecorder) for later offline processing.
